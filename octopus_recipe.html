    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place onion, garlic, bay leaf, paprika, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil
        into a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start
        to soften, about 5 minutes. Add white wine to create the braising
        liquid. Bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer octopus into braising liquid, turning to coat with the liquid.
        Cover; reduce heat to low. Simmer 20 minutes and turn octopus over.
        Continue cooking until octopus is tender, another 40 to 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat; transfer octopus to a large bowl. Pour braising liquid
        over octopus. Place bowl above a bowl of ice water to cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover bowl with plastic wrap when octopus and liquid are cool.
        Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer octopus to a work surface and mop off braising juices with
        paper towels; remove as much of the purple skin as you want. Cut octopus
        into 3 or 4 serving-size pieces. Brush with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer braising liquid to saucepan. Bring to a boil; remove from heat.
        Strain out solids; transfer liquid to a mixing bowl; let cool about 10
        minutes. Stir in lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and cayenne
        pepper to make the serving sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat. Transfer octopus pieces
        to grill. Cook until flesh is seared, almost charred, 3 or 4 minutes.
        Turn and cook other side until dark brown, caramelized, and heated
        through, another 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice octopus into fairly thick diagonal slices. Place on a serving
        dish. Spoon braising liquid mixture over the top. Dust with a bit of
        cayenne pepper, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
