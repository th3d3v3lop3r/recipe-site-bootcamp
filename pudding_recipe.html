    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup superfine sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon apricot jelly</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups cake flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup water, orange juice, or sherry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan over
        low heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine together with vinegar
        and milk. Remove from heat, and set aside. Meanwhile, sift flour, baking
        soda, and salt together into a separate bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat 1 cup sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on high speed until
        fluffy and light colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually mix in the apricot
        jam. Fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture alternately with
        warmed milk mixture using a spatula. Pour batter into a greased, 1 quart
        oven-proof baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake approximately 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center
        comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cream, butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan and stir
        over moderate heat until the butter has melted and sugar is dissolved.
        Do not allow the mixture to boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pudding from the oven, pierce several times with a skewer or
        fork, and pour the hot cream mixture immediately over the pudding. Serve
        hot or cold.
